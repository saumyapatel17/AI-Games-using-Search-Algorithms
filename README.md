# AI-Games-using-Search-Algorithms
Artificial Intelligence is becoming increasingly important in a variety of fields. Games provide a wonderful envi-ronment for experimenting with and testing these algo-rithms in a sandbox with less constraints than in real life. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is defined as a machine that can learn, reason, and solve problems like a human. We decided to test the performance of various AI algorithms by playing Snake, Sokoban, and Tic Tac Toe with them. This entailed developing a game application as well as five distinct AI searching algorithms

## Searching Algorithms
The searching algorithms are used to find or search for one or more elements in a dataset. These algorithms are used to locate components inside a given data structure. Searching can be done in a sequential or non-sequential manner. If the data in the dataset is random, sequential searching is required. Otherwise, we can lessen the complexity with a variety of approaches. In AI, searching is the ubiquitous problem-solving strategy. Tile games, Sudoku, crossword puzzles, and other single-player games are available. In such games, search algorithms assist you in finding a specific position.

We offered five techniques and strategies for creating an automated Snake Game and Sokoban solver in this re-search. We studied the performance of the various algo-rithms by analysing them and conducting experiments.
